# langorithms

Data structures and algorithms in various languages.  This project contains code snippets, notes, data structures,
algorithms, and design patterns implemented in the following languages as a way to help me learn these languages.

My goal is to spend an hour a day learning and documenting what I learned. I will have a check list for each language
to help me track what I have learned and help me move forward.

See [Langorithms](https://langorithms.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for all the notes.
