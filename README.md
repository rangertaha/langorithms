# langorithms

Data structures and algorithms in various languages.  This project contains code snippets, notes, data structures, 
algorithms, and design patterns implemented in the following languages as a way to help me learn these languages.  


My goal is to spend an hour a day learning and documenting what I learned. I will have a check list for each language 
to help me track what I have learned.
